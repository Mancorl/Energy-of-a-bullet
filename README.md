# Energy-of-a-bullet
Fun little programme i made which can calculate the energy of a bullet(or really any moving object). Sourcecode only as i never bothered building the project. The code should be viewed in Visual Studio (Not Code). This is because i used forms to interface with the code so it can only be properly viewed in Visual Studio
